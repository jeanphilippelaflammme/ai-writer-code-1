If you are an existing Arch user, 
there is no need to download a new ISO to update your existing system. You may be looking for an updated mirrorlist instead.

BitTorrent Download (recommended)
If you can spare the bytes, please leave the client open after your download is finished, so you can seed it back to others.
A DHT capable client is required. A WebSeed capable client is recommended for fastest download speeds.
